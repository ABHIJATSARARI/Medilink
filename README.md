## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform (for the blockchain component)
- [Pangea API Credentials](https://pangea.openai.com/) - You need API credentials to access Pangea services.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run MediLink:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Abhijatsarari/medilink.git
   cd medilink
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Pangea API Credentials:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add your Pangea API credentials to the `.env` file:
     ```shell
     PANGEA_API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```

4. **Start the Blockchain Component:**
   - Launch the blockchain component using Docker:
     ```shell
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the MediLink application.

## Pangea API Usage

MediLink utilizes Pangea APIs in the following key areas:

1. **Secure Data Storage:** Pangea APIs are used to securely store metadata associated with medical records, such as patient demographics, treatment history, and access logs, in a secure and compliant manner.

2. **Transaction Processing:** Pangea APIs facilitate secure transactions, enabling the addition of verified medical records to the blockchain. This ensures the tamper-proof nature of the stored data.

3. **Data Retrieval:** Pangea APIs allow authorized users, including patients and healthcare providers, to retrieve medical records securely. The APIs ensure that data access is controlled, audited, and compliant with privacy regulations.

4. **Integration with Blockchain:** Pangea APIs seamlessly integrate with the blockchain technology used for medical records storage, creating a robust and secure infrastructure for the network.
